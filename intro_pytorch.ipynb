To create our LogisticRegression model that inherits from `torch.nn.Module`, we need to define two methods: `__init__()` and `forward()`. `__init__()` initializes the model parameters and assigns layers to object attributes. The `forward()` method computes the forward pass of the model by passing minibatches of input data through the different layers of the model.\n",

Typically, after the `Linear` layer we would implement a softmax activation function that converts our output to a multinomial probability distribution. However, PyTorch has a way of building this calculation into its loss functions. This helps model stability during training. Therefore, we won't add a softmax activation function for our models and instead leave that calculation to PyTorch's loss functions.\n"

    "\n",
    "Now that we've defined our loss function as a way of quantifying how good or bad our model predictions are, we can improve our model by changing the parameters in a way that minimizes the loss. For neural networks, this is done via [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation): we take the gradient of the loss with respect to model parameters and take a \"step\" in the direction that reduces our loss. If we were not using a deep learning framework like PyTorch, we would have to go through and derive all the gradients ourselves by hand, then code them into our training pipeline. Luckily, Pytorch has automated gradient calculation with [`torch.autograd`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html): an \"automatic differentiation engine that powers neural network training\" [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we define our optimizer and the learning rate we'll use for training the model. [`torch.optim`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html) is a package of various, commonly-used optimization algorithms implementations. A `torch.optim` optimizer object will keep track of the current state of model parameters and update the parameters based on the gradients computed by `torch.autograd`. To construct an optimizer you must provide an iterable containing the model parameters to optimize. This can be done by calling the `parameters()` method of our model (a method that is inherited from `torch.nn.Module`). Then, you can specify optimizer-specific options such as the learning rate and weight decay. For many deep learning applications, standard [stochastic gradient descent](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/sgd.html) (SGD) optimizes models during training quite well. We can use PyTorch's `torch.optim` implementation of SGD as our optimizer.\n"

    "### 6.5. Evaluate MLP model on test set\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll now evaluate our MLP model on the test set. The added expressivity and complexity of our model can be a double-edged sword. While this added complexity gives our model the capacity to learn more complex, non-linear relationships, we must now also be weary of [overfitting](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/overfitting). Overfitting occurs when a model learns the information represented in training data to the point where it's performance on hold-out data is negatively influenced. Deep learning models can have millions (sometimes [billions](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/openai-presents-gpt-3-a-175-billion-parameters-language-model/)!) of trainable parameters, which means that the number of model parameters can be greater than the number of data points on which the model is trained. These \"over-parametrized\" models can be prone to overfitting, especially in cases of small data. Here, we're hoping that our test accuracy is similar to our training accuracy of around 96%-97%. As we'll see, our model did not overfit the training set and achieves a comparable test set accuracy.\n"
